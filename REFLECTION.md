The part of the code that was most confusing to me was the setInterval and clearInterval logic because of the two if statements. I eventually understood that the logic entailed looping through the entire array of frames for a given number of times before stopping the animation.



The animation helps visualize asynchronous behavior by running without freezing the browser.



I wrote "const colors = \[]" and each frame in the array appeared in a different color.
